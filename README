Building from Source
--------------------

The "master" branch is for building against PG 9.4...   The "9.3" branch 
is for PG 9.3.   If you need a version built against an older version of 
PG then let me know (denisl@openscg.com).

For installation there must be PostgreSQL dev environment installed
and pg_config in the PATH.   Then just run:

	$ make
	$ make install

To run regression tests:

	$ make installcheck

Notes:

* Location to pg_config can be set via PG_CONFIG variable:

	$ make PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config
	$ make install PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config
	$ make installcheck PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config
